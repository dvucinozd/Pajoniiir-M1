# Pajoniiir-M1 Rust Product Requirements

**Status:** baseline v0.1  
**Recorded:** 2026-09-24  
**Target:** Pajoniiir-M1 custom ESP32-P4 mainboard  
**Software direction:** native Rust, bare-metal/no_std application architecture

## 1. Purpose and authority

This document defines the product-level acceptance requirements for the Pajoniiir-M1 Rust firmware.

The authorities are intentionally split:

1. **Pajoniiir M2.2** is the functional/product golden reference. M1 Rust must preserve or deliberately supersede its released DJ behavior.
2. **Pajoniiir-M1 hardware contracts** are the electrical and board-integration authority.
3. **Pajoniiir-M3** is supporting hardware/integration evidence only; it is not the feature-parity target.
4. **Current Rust ecosystem documentation** defines the initial implementation baseline but does not override product behavior.

M1 Rust R1 is not accepted merely because it boots or compiles on ESP32-P4. It is accepted only after all MUST requirements have equivalent regression evidence and all hardware-dependent MUST gates have been physically qualified.

## 2. Frozen starting baseline

Initial dependency/target assumptions as of 2026-09-24:

- ESP32-P4NRW32X, M1 production target silicon v3.2 or newer approved revision.
- Rust target: `riscv32imafc-unknown-none-elf`.
- `esp-hal 1.2.0`, with ESP32-P4 support for chip revision >= v3.x.
- `esp-hal` P4 USB, MIPI DSI, I2S, SDMMC and PSRAM APIs are treated as unstable integration surfaces.
- Slint `1.18.1`.
- embedded-graphics `0.8.2`.
- Rust toolchain baseline `1.95.0`, matching the current esp-hal 1.2.0 minimum Rust version.
- ESP-IDF application runtime / FreeRTOS / esp-idf-sys are not the permanent M1 application architecture.

All exact dependency versions and `Cargo.lock` shall be committed before an executable firmware baseline is accepted. Any esp-hal minor upgrade is a qualified platform change because M1 relies on unstable P4 peripheral APIs.

## 3. Verification vocabulary

Every requirement/evidence item shall use one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| HOST_VERIFIED | Deterministic host tests pass on supported desktop CI. |
| SIMULATOR_VERIFIED | Behavior is demonstrated in the desktop/UI simulator with golden evidence where applicable. |
| COMPILE_VERIFIED | Correct target build/link succeeds, but physical behavior is not claimed. |
| HARDWARE_PENDING | Requires M1/P4 hardware or attached peripheral hardware. |
| HARDWARE_VERIFIED | Physical acceptance procedure passed and evidence is recorded. |

No requirement may be promoted from COMPILE_VERIFIED to HARDWARE_VERIFIED by inference.

## 4. Priority classes

- **MUST** — required for M1 Rust R1 product release.
- **SHOULD** — intended for R1 if it does not compromise MUST closure.
- **LATER** — explicitly deferred and must not delay R1.

## 5. MUST requirements

| M1R-P0-037 | USB MIDI transport and profile runtime are separate crates/interfaces. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-038 | Do not advertise a non-FLX4 controller as physically supported until MIDI/LED/UAC hardware qualification exists for that model. | Documentation gate |

| M1R-P0-046 | Audio/deck logic consumes a media abstraction and does not depend directly on USB/FAT implementation details. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-047 | microSD is a secondary/background medium and shall not violate the primary audio deadlines. | HOST_VERIFIED / HARDWARE_PENDING |

### 5.5 Rekordbox and neutral analysis

| M1R-P0-052 | Rekordbox waveform, BPM, beatgrid and cue import has golden parity fixtures against released behavior. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-053 | Analysis generations are immutable; a playing deck pins the generation it consumes until a safe upgrade boundary. | HOST_VERIFIED |

### 5.6 UI and waveform

|---|---|---|
| M1R-P0-060 | Slint is the M1 primary UI framework. | SIMULATOR_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-061 | Desktop simulator uses the same UI model and Slint views intended for M1. | SIMULATOR_VERIFIED |

| M1R-P0-066 | UI screenshot/golden tests cover stable representative states. | SIMULATOR_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-067 | Only the UI task/context may call Slint; other subsystems publish bounded messages/snapshots. | HOST_VERIFIED |

### 5.7 Audio real-time contract

| ID | Requirement | Pre-hardware evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M1R-P0-070 | Deadline-critical audio path performs no filesystem I/O, network I/O, OTA work, controller-profile parsing or unbounded allocation. | HOST_VERIFIED |

### 5.8 Settings, diagnostics and health

| ID | Requirement | Pre-hardware evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M1R-P0-080 | Settings/state storage is versioned and migrated; raw Rust struct layout is never the persistent format. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-081 | Persist at least released settings semantics: backlight, elapsed/remaining mode, cue mode, master trim preset and Wi-Fi remote enable state as applicable. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-082 | Persistent Hot Cue state survives normal reboot and rejects corrupt/incompatible records safely. | HOST_VERIFIED |

| M1R-P0-084 | M1 telemetry adds INA238/system power, USB VBUS/fault state, memory reserves, recovery counts, audio/UAC metrics, storage faults, C6 link, OTA state and reset reason. | HOST_VERIFIED / HARDWARE_PENDING |
| M1R-P0-085 | Firmware health tracks running image identity, candidate/rollback state and explicit readiness. | HOST_VERIFIED |

### 5.9 OTA and recovery

| ID | Requirement | Pre-hardware evidence |
|---|---|---|
| M1R-P0-090 | Signed application update bundles remain mandatory; preserve `.ddjota` compatibility where technically practical. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-091 | A/B update, interrupted-transfer safety, rollback and wired recovery are MUST behavior. | HOST_VERIFIED / HARDWARE_PENDING |

| M1R-P0-101 | Wi-Fi Remote preserves released transport, waveform seek, library/status/diagnostics, controller-profile update and signed OTA capability. | HOST_VERIFIED / SIMULATOR_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-102 | Web API contract tests prevent browser state from diverging from authoritative device state. | HOST_VERIFIED |
| M1R-P0-103 | ESP32-C6 networking transport is isolated behind a platform/network interface so host tests do not require C6 hardware. | HOST_VERIFIED |

## 6. SHOULD requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| M1R-P1-001 | Integrate libapta behind the neutral `TrackAnalysis` provider boundary after its upstream embedded/release gates are satisfied. |
| M1R-P1-002 | Support ordinary MP3/WAV/FLAC folder libraries in addition to Rekordbox media. |
| M1R-P1-003 | Implement versioned `/PAJONIIIR` sidecars/catalog/playlists with transactional writes and stale-part recovery. |
| M1R-P1-004 | Add bounded tag readers for ID3v2.3/v2.4, FLAC Vorbis comments and WAV RIFF/INFO. |
| M1R-P1-005 | Add factory firmware target for board bring-up and manufacturing/service tests. |
| M1R-P1-006 | Add property tests, fuzzing and fault injection for parsers, profile format, OTA manifest, media identity and storage write boundaries. |
| M1R-P1-007 | Qualify production Secure Boot v2 + Flash Encryption release provisioning on dedicated pilot hardware before batch enablement. |
| M1R-P1-008 | Add M1-specific power/current health thresholds using INA238 evidence. |

## 7. LATER requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| M1R-P2-001 | Audio recorder: retain design/test knowledge but do not make R1 release depend on recorder enablement until SD latency and power-loss behavior are qualified. |
| M1R-P2-002 | SysEx/MIDI-CI extensions beyond the current 3-byte note/CC profile model. |
| M1R-P2-003 | Controller-independent headphone output using an additional onboard stereo DAC/codec + headphone amplifier, if the product decision requires full cue support with MIDI-only controllers. |

## 8. Controller-independent cue product gate

The current M1 hardware provides:

- PCM5102A MAIN stereo output.
- Headphone cue through a compatible DJ controller USB audio interface.

Therefore a MIDI-only controller can control M1 but cannot provide controller-independent headphone cue with the current board.

Before final PCB layout freeze, product ownership must explicitly choose one of:

- **A:** MIDI-only controllers are supported for control, but CUE requires a compatible USB-audio controller.
- **B:** add a second stereo DAC/codec + headphone amplifier + 3.5 mm output to M1.

This is a hardware/product decision, not a software workaround.

## 9. Host-first development sequence

The pre-hardware sequence is:

1. lock this requirements baseline and architecture ADRs;
2. create Rust workspace and desktop simulator;
3. implement waveform renderer and golden images;
4. port semantic controller core and S3CP v2;
5. port reconnect/state reconciliation/LED replay;
6. port deck/mixer/hot-cue/loop/Beat Jump/Sync logic;
7. introduce media identity and neutral TrackAnalysis;
8. port Rekordbox parsers/fixtures;
9. port audio/DSP as deterministic host-testable code;
10. add storage, OTA, Web API, settings and telemetry state machines;
11. add P4 BSP/driver adapters and compile gates;
12. execute hardware bring-up only when M1 EVT hardware exists.

## 10. Hardware bring-up order

When EVT hardware becomes available:

`boot/service -> flash/PSRAM -> rails/INA238 -> PCM5102A -> DSI/Slint/touch -> USB0 MSC -> USB1 MIDI -> USB1 UAC -> C6 SDIO/Wi-Fi -> integrated stress -> OTA/rollback -> release soak`

Each step creates recorded HARDWARE_VERIFIED evidence; later steps do not retroactively waive earlier failures.

## 11. R1 release gate

M1 Rust R1 is releasable only when:

- every MUST requirement is closed with the required evidence class;
- the M2.2-equivalent host regression corpus is green or superseded by documented stronger tests;
- desktop UI/waveform golden tests are green;
- exact Rust dependencies and toolchain are locked;
- unsafe code is confined to reviewed hardware/FFI boundary crates;
- no product crate depends directly on unstable esp-hal APIs;
- all required M1 hardware gates are HARDWARE_VERIFIED;
- OTA interruption, rollback and candidate-readiness tests pass;
- controller support claims match actual physical qualification evidence;
- release documentation lists remaining accepted limitations explicitly.
